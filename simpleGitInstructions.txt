when making a new git repository on your local machine, go to
the directory you want to use and init it with 'git init'.

Then use 'git clone _______' where ______ is is the https address
retreived from github.com.

In order to check the status of your local repo against the master repo
use 'git status'.

To commit your local changes use 'git add'. This will make it a file to
be committed. Then use 'git commit -m "message here"' to commit it to the
repository on your machine. Then use 'git push' to push it to the universal
master.

To get files on the master that are not local use 'git pull'.
